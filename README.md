# Live Lyrics Manager v2.0

A Python script for OBS Studio designed to manage and display song lyrics from `.show` files. It features a modern, stay-on-top GUI with live-editing capabilities, agenda management, and a real-time preview panel.

This script allows you to make instant text corrections from a dedicated control window and have them appear live on your OBS text source, without needing to save the file first.

## Features

* **Live Editing:** Instantly see changes from the editor in your OBS text source and the preview panel.
* **Manual Save:** Edits are temporary and held in memory. They are **not** permanently saved to your `.show` file until you manually press the "Save Modifications" button.
* **Agenda (Playlist):** Build, manage, and reorder a setlist for your event.
* **Live Preview:** A built-in panel shows you exactly what is being sent to OBS, including a "HIDDEN" status.
* **Smart Search:** Quickly find songs by title, number, or lyrics within the selected category.
* **Compatibility:** Designed to read, parse, and edit `.show` file libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

1.  **OBS Studio:** A recent version of OBS Studio (27.x or newer).
2.  **Python:** A compatible version of Python (e.g., 3.6 to 3.11) installed on your system.
3.  **OBS Python Configuration:** You must configure OBS to point to your Python installation.
    * In OBS, go to **Tools -> Scripts**.
    * Click the **Python Settings** tab.
    * Set the **Python Installation Path** to the directory where your Python is installed (e.g., `C:/Python311/` or `/usr/bin/python3`).
4.  **Song Library:** You must have a folder containing your song library as `.show` files. Subfolders will be treated as categories.
5.  **OBS Text Source:** You must have a **Text (GDI+)** source added to the scene where you want lyrics to appear.
